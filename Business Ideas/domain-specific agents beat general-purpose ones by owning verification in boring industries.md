# Domain-specific agents beat general-purpose ones by owning verification in boring industries

The general-purpose agent layer is being captured by giants (Claude, OpenAI, Perplexity). Indie builders can't compete on models, UX, or distribution. The play is going deep into a specific industry where workflows are messy, data is weird, language is specialized, ROI is obvious, and incumbents don't bother because it's "too small."

## Key Takeaways

The target industries share a pattern: money moves through documents and handoffs. Geology exploration reports, insurance claims, pharma QA batch records, construction change orders, food safety audits, railway inspection reports. The rule of thumb: if it creates PDFs, requires spreadsheets, follows set processes, or generates email threads — it's automatable. These are industries where a senior operator's knowledge is the bottleneck, not compute.

Domain immersion can be compressed from six months to a week using agents as a research team. Feed 3-5 core textbooks, SOPs, ISO standards, and regulatory docs into an agent. Have it build a glossary, concepts map, practical priorities, and common failure modes. Then mine practitioner knowledge from forums, incident reports, and audit findings to learn "what breaks" and "how people actually solve it."

The automation target is always the "repetitive middle" of a workflow: collect → normalize → validate → generate → verify → submit. Map each workflow by asking: what's the final deliverable, what inputs create it, who touches it, where are decisions vs mechanical work, what are the top 10 failure points, and what's the cost of delay or errors.

Every niche has an unbranded pain point hiding inside it — data you can't trust, reports that bounce through revisions for weeks, compliance checks that live in one person's head, scheduling chaos from implicit constraints. The product framing is always: "turn messy inputs into a verified, submission-ready artifact."

Verification is the moat, not generation. General agents suggest; niche agents prove. The pipeline skeleton is: ingest → parse (OCR + structured extraction) → normalize (schemas, units, naming) → validate (rule checks + anomaly detection) → generate (report, checklist, recommendation) → verify (citations + confidence + human review gates) → deliver (client format, submission, audit trail).

The go-to-market is a single outcome for a single role — "exploration report autopilot for junior geologists" or "QA batch record verifier for pharma" — then expand sideways to adjacent tasks once you own trust and data.

> **Step-by-step process:**
> 1. Pick a "boring" domain with expensive repetition (geology, insurance, pharma QA, construction, food safety, etc.)
> 2. Use agents to compress domain learning from 6 months to a week
> 3. Map the workflow like an engineer — find the repetitive middle
> 4. Find the unbranded pain point inside the workflow
> 5. Build a dedicated automation pipeline with verification as the moat
> 6. Ship a wedge for one role, then expand sideways
>
> General purpose is a treadmill. Depth is leverage.
