# Evaluation & Monitoring

Measuring agent quality, observability, regression testing, production monitoring, and drift detection.

## Notes

- [[agent production monitoring requires observing inputs and outputs not just system metrics]]
- [[AI generated code repos gain credibility by shipping verification artifacts not hiding authorship]]
