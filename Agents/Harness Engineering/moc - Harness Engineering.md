# Harness Engineering

Designing the scaffolding around agents — system prompts, AGENTS.md patterns, soul files, tool descriptions, prompt engineering, and middleware between the model and the world.

## Notes

- [[claude CLI print mode is a full agent runtime accessible via command line]]
- [[designing agent tools is an iterative art shaped by model capabilities not fixed engineering rules]]
- [[harness engineering improved a coding agent 13 points by changing only system prompts tools and middleware]]
