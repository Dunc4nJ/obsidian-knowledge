## Key Takeaways

STP (Self-play Theorem Prover) provides the most mathematically rigorous instantiation of the adversarial self-play paradigm in this collection. The conjecturer generates formal mathematical statements, and the prover attempts to prove them using a formal verifier (Lean or Isabelle) as the ground-truth discriminator. This is structurally identical to a GAN where the generator produces conjectures at the prover's difficulty frontier, and the verifier acts as a perfect discriminator -- it cannot be fooled, only satisfied.

The core insight is that expert iteration plateaus because of sparse rewards: at 13.2% pass rate on LeanWorkbook, 98.5% of compute generates incorrect proofs that provide zero training signal. STP breaks through this ceiling by having the conjecturer generate statements calibrated to the prover's current capability -- at least 47% of generated conjectures are successfully proved, compared to the near-zero success rate on hard dataset problems. This is the same learnability principle as [[absolute zero achieves SOTA reasoning without any training data|Absolute Zero]]'s proposer reward (r_propose = 1 - r_solve when r_solve > 0), but applied to the formal mathematics domain where the verification signal is provably correct.

The conjecturer reward design is sophisticated and addresses failure modes specific to self-play in open-ended generation. Conjectures must have pass rate in (0, 1/4] -- challenging but approachable. An elegancy filter removes artificially hard conjectures with long proofs relative to statement length. Most critically, a Wasserstein distance-based reweighting prevents mode collapse by pushing the distribution of generated conjectures toward the distribution of unproved statements. Without this, the conjecturer collapses to generating only algebraic inequality problems, ignoring number theory and other topics. This diversity maintenance mechanism echoes the coverage concerns in [[AgentGen]] and [[Curiosity-Driven Red Teaming]], where adversarial generators must balance difficulty against diversity.

The requirement that generated conjectures use the same lemma as the seed theorem's proof is a clever structural constraint that maintains relevance without being overly restrictive. It ensures conjectures are thematically related to existing mathematics while allowing substantial creative variation. The generated examples are illuminating: one conjecture generalizes (1+x)^2 >= 1+x^2 to (1+x)^{2n} >= 1+x^n, demonstrating meaningful mathematical creativity that extends rather than trivially modifies the seed.

The scaling results are dramatic: STP proves 28.5% of LeanWorkbook (doubling the previous 13.2%) and achieves SOTA on miniF2F-test (65.0% pass@3200), ProofNet-test (23.9%), and PutnamBench (8/644). The cumulative pass rate curves show clear separation between STP and expert iteration, with the gap widening over time. This sustained improvement, in contrast to expert iteration's plateau, demonstrates that adversarial curriculum generation fundamentally changes the scaling behavior of RL-based training.

The connection to automated curriculum learning is explicit: STP can be viewed as self-generated adaptive curriculum learning via conjecturers, directly linking to the principles explored in [[PAIRED]], [[PLR]], and [[ACCEL]]. However, STP's curriculum emerges from the mathematical structure of proof rather than from engineered environment parameters, making it arguably more principled and certainly more domain-appropriate.

> 
> The reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) is critical for various applications, including coding assistants, question-answering, and agents [Plaat et al., 2024, Shinn et al., 2023, Yao et al., 2022, Shao et al., 2024, Li et al.,
> 2023, Nijkamp et al., 2022]. It is also a key criterion for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Automated
> theorem proving with formal languages by LLMs stands at the forefront of reasoning research [Yang et al., 2024a],
> partly because it allows objective and reliable evaluation through classical verifiers such as Lean [Moura and Ullrich,
> 2021] and Isabelle [Nipkow et al., 2002]. Moreover, it arguably encapsulates the essence of advanced reasoning tasks
> while abstracting away the ambiguity of natural language, enabling meaningful studies on a relatively smaller scale.
> However, a fundamental challenge in improving reasoning performance—whether in natural or formal languages—lies in the lack of high-quality training data. Collecting reasoning data requires domain experts, making
> it expensive to scale. There are only a limited number of advanced math papers and theorems in existence, orders of
> magnitude smaller than other data sources.
> Reinforcement learning (RL) on datasets _without_ solutions (e.g., datasets with theorem statements or reasoning
> questions and answers) is a prominent approach for improving the reasoning capability, as seen in the recent development of OpenAI o1 Jaech et al. [2024], DeepSeek-Prover [Xin et al., 2024a] and DeepSeek R1 [Guo et al., 2025].
> Often referred to as expert iteration [Anthony et al., 2017], it partially mitigates the data scarcity issue by alternating
> between LLMs generating proofs and finetuning them on correctly generated ones [Kaliszyk et al., 2018, Wu et al.,
> 2021, AlphaProof, 2024, Xin et al., 2024b, Ying et al., 2024].
> However, as Wu et al. [2024] pointed out, RL or expert iteration often saturates at a low pass rate because the
> number of samples required to generate a correct proof for an unproven theorem grows exponentially. As a result, a

> In this paper, we design Self-play Theorem Prover (STP), which mimics how mathematicians learn and develop
> mathematics. It simultaneously assumes two roles—conjecturer and prover—providing training signals to each other.
> As illustrated in Fig. 1, the conjecturer, given a seed theorem with proof, proposes a new, related conjecture (Step
> 1), while the prover attempts to prove conjectures and statements from an existing dataset (Step 2). Then, the verifier
> selects correct proofs (Step 3) to train the prover using standard RL and identifies correct, approachable, elegant, yet
> challenging conjectures to supervise the training of the conjecturer (Step 4). More concretely, in each iteration, the
> conjecturer is trained on previously generated conjectures that: (a) are barely provable by the current prover (i.e., the
> prover’s success probability with respect to its random seed is positive but low), and (b) pass certain elegancy filters.
> This iterative process gradually increases the difficulty of conjectures and proofs without requiring additional data.

> For the Lean experiments, we choose DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-SFT as our base model, which is trained on proofs collected by expert iteration on a combination of public, such as LeanWorkbook, miniF2F-valid [Zheng et al., 2021], and
> ProofNet-valid [Azerbayev et al., 2023a], and proprietary datasets. We run 48 iterations of STP and generated 3.6M
> conjectures, 241M proofs, and 51.3B tokens in total. We use the cumulative pass rate, defined by the fraction of statements proved during the entire training, as the main metric for training progress. Fig. 2 plots the cumulative pass rate
> of STP and two major baselines, expert iteration, and parallel sampling, on the training dataset LeanWorkbook [Ying
> et al., 2024]. Expert iteration alternates between generating proofs to the statements in the given dataset and finetuning
> the model on correct proofs. (See discussions and comparison about variants of expert iteration in Appendix A.6.)
> Parallel sampling simply generates proofs with the given model. Fig. 2 shows that STP achieves significantly better
> scaling than expert iteration, which simulates the performance of DeepSeek’s model as if it were trained for more
> iterations.
> Since the formal statements in our training dataset, LeanWorkbook, are translated from natural language statements, they are not always provable. In Appendix B.3, we randomly select 20 unproved statements from LeanWorkbook and manually assess whether (a) the formal statement is an accurate translation of the natural language
> statement, and (b) the formal statement itself is correct and provable. We find that 16 out of the 20 statements are
> translated correctly, but only 7 statements are provable and the remaining 13 statements are unprovable (e.g., due to
> missing assumptions in the corresponding natural language statement), suggesting that the best possible pass rate on
> LeanWorkbook, with a 95% confidence interval, is between 38.7% and 68.5%.
> In Table 1, we compare the final re-trained model of STP with prior works on two common benchmarks, miniF2Ftest and ProofNet-test, which contain formal statements of high-school level and college level math questions, respectively. Among the whole-proof generation methods, STP significantly outperforms DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-RL
> (which is continuously trained with RL on top of their SFT model) and achieves SoTA performance across various
> inference-time sample budgets. We also report the performance of the model trained only on LeanWorkbook for 24 iterations, excluding miniF2F-valid and proofnet-valid, demonstrating that the model trained with STP also generalizes

> In the following, we present the pseudo-code for selecting the conjecturing imports. Recall that the input for the

> conjectures, we randomly select a subset whose size does not exceed the number of remaining unproved statements in
> the given dataset, so that the prover’s sample budget is distributed equally between the conjectures and the statements.
> We run two heuristic methods to ensure the diversity of the inputs. First, we make sure that each lemma _l_ appears

> **A.5** **Re-weighting the conjecturing dataset**
> 
> 
> In this section, we describe the motivations and implementation details of the re-weighting method for the conjecturing
> dataset.
> 
> 
> **Motivation.** In our early experiments, we observe that the generated conjectures tend to have mode collapse issue
> after several iterations of self-play training. For example, the generated conjectures are mostly about algebraic manipulations even when the seed statements contain questions about, for example, number theory. This is partly because
> the LeanWorkbook dataset contains a significant portion of inequality questions.
> Therefore, in addition to the particular conjecturing format where we require that the proof of the conjecture must
> use the lemma given in the input, we also re-weight the conjecturing examples at every iteration. Intuitively, if there is
> a distance function that can separate statements of different topics, the Wasserstein projection of the conjectures will
> have a similar distribution of topics, and therefore alleviates the mode collapsing issue.
> 
> 
> **Cost function.** We compute the cost _d_ ( _x, y_ ) of matching conjecture _x_ to a statement _y_ by the negative of the cosine
> similarity between their embeddings, and the embedding is computed by the last hidden layer of the current model
> averaged over the sequence dimension. Since our model is trained to generate proofs of conjectures and statements,
> we expect that statements with similar proof techniques tend to have similar embeddings, and therefore smaller cost
> for the matching.
> 
> 
> **Algorithm.** On the high level, our method computes a re-weighting of the generated conjectures that minimizes its
> Wasserstein distance to the unproved statements in the given dataset. Abstractly speaking, let _X_ be the set of generated
> conjectures, and _Q_ the set of unproved statements. Let _d_ ( _x, y_ ) be the distance between a conjecture _x_ and a statement
> _y_ . Then, the optimization problem can be written as

> argmin _W_ ( _P, Q_ ) _,_ (1)
> _P_ : _P_ is a valid distribution, supp( _P_ ) _⊆X_
> 
> 
> where _W_ ( _P, Q_ ) is the Wasserstein distance between _P_ and _Q_ (with little abuse of notation, we use _Q_ to represent the
> uniform distribution over the unproved statements). The Wasserstein distance _W_ ( _P, Q_ ) is defined by the following
