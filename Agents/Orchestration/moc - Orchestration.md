# Orchestration

Multi-agent coordination — delegation patterns, lead/worker ratios, communication between agents, state machines, and squad architectures.

## Notes

- [[2 to 5 worker agents per lead is the sweet spot for multi agent orchestration]]
- [[Athena is a vault librarian agent that maintains structure links and capture workflows]]
- [[agents should coordinate via push messaging not through a human copying context between terminals]]
- [[background agents shift alerting from reactive keyword matching to proactive semantic discovery]]
- [[codex custom multi-agent roles unlock repeatable subagent specialization]]
- [[intelligent AI delegation requires trust accountability and adaptive monitoring not just task decomposition]]
- [[multi-agent squads work when independent sessions share a mission control system]]
- [[orchestration architecture determines multi-agent investment quality]]
- [[simple financial agents outperform complex ones when tool routing is tight]]
