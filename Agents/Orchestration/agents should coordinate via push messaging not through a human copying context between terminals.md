description: Agent Relay is an SDK that gives AI agents real-time peer-to-peer messaging channels, replacing the human as the bottleneck message bus between multiple coding agents working on the same problem.

## Key Takeaways

The core problem is viscerally familiar: you have multiple agent terminals open, you're copying errors from CI into Claude, pasting feedback from Codex into OpenCode, manually shuttling context between a planner and an executor. You are the message bus. Agent Relay replaces that with direct push communication between agents — channels, reactions, read receipts — essentially Slack for headless agents. This is a different approach to the same coordination problem that [[intelligent AI delegation requires trust accountability and adaptive monitoring not just task decomposition|intelligent delegation frameworks]] address at a theoretical level, but here it's a concrete SDK.

The key distinction from subagents is worth noting. Subagents are hierarchical (parent → child → result) which works for isolated subtasks but breaks for long-running collaborative work where agents need real-time feedback loops. Relay enables **peer conversations** — agents at the same level discussing, evaluating, and adjusting plans without waiting for a human checkpoint. This is the "non-hierarchical delegation" case from the delegation paper, implemented as a library.

Cross-provider support is the other big differentiator. You can spawn a Claude agent and a Codex agent on the same channel and they just talk to each other. The tic-tac-toe example (Claude Sonnet as Player X, GPT-5.3 Codex Spark as Player O) is toy but illustrative — the same primitive scales to planner/executor/researcher workflows where you want the best model per role.

The SDK is minimal — `npm install @agent-relay/sdk`, spawn agents with `relay.claude.spawn()` or `relay.codex.spawn()`, put them on named channels, and let them go. You can observe and interject but don't have to be the runtime. Currently supports Claude and Codex CLIs.

> You have multiple terminals open. One agent is building a plan. Another is executing it. You're tabbing between them like a very patient middle manager. You copy errors out of CI and paste them into Claude. You paste feedback from Codex into OpenCode. You press enter to say yes, it's totally fine that claude runs find . -type f -name "*.ts" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -Hn "any" just this once. Your research agent finds something interesting and writes it to a SUPER_DETAILED_RESEARCH.md document. Your planner needs it, but after pasting the markdown in the planner finds something else it needs context on. So you find the other terminal and copy the markdown back into the research prompt. Then you tweak the plan. Then you adjust the codex terminal running the plan. Then you review the output. Then you start again because it wasn't quite right. Ugh, compacting again?! Man… I'm exhausted. Software used to be fun! You know what's not fun? Being a glorified message bus for a bunch of LLMs.

> 1. Subagents are hierarchical. (i.e Parent → child → result) That works for "do this subtask." but it breaks for systems or long running work. What happens when you need to adjust or have feedback in real time? With relay, you can still take advantage of subagents (and should!) to complete a subtask. With relay, you can have peer conversations back and forth to come to a conclusion. This generally allows for more creative and emergent solutions.

> 2. Subagents don't work cross provider. You want to be able to use the best model from multiple providers for the given task and you want it to work seamlessly with other agents.
