# Continual Learning Data Agent

Research and frameworks for building AI agents that persistently learn, remember, and improve across sessions.

## Research Papers

- **MemSkill** — Learning and Evolving Memory Skills for Self-Evolving Agents (PDF)
- **ProcMEM** — Learning Reusable Procedural Memory from Experience via Non-Parametric PPO for LLM Agents (PDF)

## Frameworks

- [[file-based personal OS gives AI agents persistent identity and judgment across sessions]] — file-based operating system using markdown, YAML, and JSONL in Git for persistent agent context, episodic memory, and voice encoding
