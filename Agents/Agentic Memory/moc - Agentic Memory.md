# Agentic Memory

How agents store, retrieve, and evolve knowledge across sessions. Memory architectures, vault-as-memory patterns, state persistence, context survival across compaction.

## Notes

- [[Obsidian as Agentic Memory]]
- [[Obsidian wikilink resolution can be replicated on plain filesystems with an index and atomic rename tool]]
- [[PARA and atomic facts give AI agents durable structured memory]]
- [[four memory layers serve different knowledge types]]
- [[git hooks as thinking journal let you time-travel through note evolution]]
- [[inline annotations beat copy-paste editing by keeping instructions where they belong]]
- [[obsidian vaults become memory graphs when agents traverse wikilinked notes with claim-based titles and layered orientation]]
- [[progressive disclosure filters force agent selectivity over what enters context]]
- [[transcript mining turns meetings into captured decisions and extracted knowledge]]
