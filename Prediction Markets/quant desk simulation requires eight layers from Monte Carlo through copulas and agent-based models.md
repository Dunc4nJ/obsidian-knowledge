## Key Takeaways

The article builds a complete quantitative simulation stack for prediction markets in eight progressive layers. It starts with the insight that retail traders treat prediction market contracts as simple coin flips, ignoring correlation, information flow, execution risk, and portfolio effects — the same oversimplification that [[prediction markets are the purest test of quantitative finance because every position resolves to truth]] identifies as the gap between casual and institutional trading.

Monte Carlo simulation is the foundation, but naive implementations break on tail-risk contracts. A contract trading at $0.003 (like "S&P drops 20% in one week") yields zero or one hit across 100,000 samples. Importance sampling via exponential tilting achieves 100-10,000x variance reduction by oversampling the rare region and correcting with a likelihood ratio — turning "we can't price this" into "we're trading it." This connects directly to [[kelly criterion determines optimal prediction market bet size from three inputs]] since accurate probability estimation is a prerequisite for Kelly sizing.

Sequential Monte Carlo (particle filters) solve the real-time updating problem: when new data arrives (election returns, market moves), a particle filter smooths noise and propagates uncertainty rather than naively trusting each price tick. This is the dynamic counterpart to the static calibration work in [[prediction market calibration error is a structured surface not a scalar and its flattening signals lost price discovery]].

The copula section is arguably the most important for portfolio traders. Gaussian copulas have zero tail dependence — catastrophically wrong for correlated prediction markets. Student-t copulas with v=4 show 2-5x higher probability of extreme joint outcomes (all swing states flipping together). This is the exact failure mode that caused the 2008 financial crisis and would repeat in any prediction market portfolio using Gaussian dependency assumptions. The [[polymarket arbitrage trading requires barrier frank-wolfe initialization and adaptive contraction]] framework implicitly assumes some correlation structure — this article makes explicit what that structure should be.

The agent-based modeling section reveals a counterintuitive result: zero-intelligence agents (completely random traders) achieve near-100% allocative efficiency in continuous double auctions (Gode & Sunder 1993), and a single-parameter model explains 96% of spread variation on the London Stock Exchange. This has implications for [[polymarket market making requires avellaneda-stoikov reservation pricing adapted for binary settlement]] — market microstructure may be more mechanistic than most makers assume.

Three variance reduction techniques (antithetic variates, control variates, stratified sampling) stack multiplicatively to achieve 100-500x improvement over crude Monte Carlo. The article positions this as "table stakes" for production systems, not optional refinement.

> Vine Copula
>
> For d>5 contracts, bivariate copulas are insufficient. Vine copulas decompose the d-dimensional dependency into d(d−1)/2 bivariate conditional copulas arranged in a tree structure:
>
> - C-vine (star): One central event drives everything (e.g., presidential winner -> all policy markets)
> - D-vine (path): Sequential dependencies (e.g., primary results flow into general election)
> - R-vine (general graph): Maximum flexibility
>
> build maximum spanning trees ordered by |τ_Kendall|, select pair-copula families via AIC, estimate sequentially. Implementations: pyvinecopulib (Python), VineCopula (R).

> But prediction markets are populated by heterogeneous agents - informed traders, noise traders, market makers, and bots whose interactions produce emergent dynamics that no closed-form SDE can capture.

> Gode & Sunder (1993) showed that zero-intelligence agents - traders who submit random orders subject only to budget constraints achieve near-100% allocative efficiency in a continuous double auction.
