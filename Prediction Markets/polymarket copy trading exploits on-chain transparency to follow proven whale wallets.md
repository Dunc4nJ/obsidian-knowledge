## Key Takeaways

Polymarket settles every trade on Polygon as ERC-1155 tokens, which means every wallet's full history — entries, exits, sizes, prices — is permanently public. This is the fundamental asymmetry that makes copy trading viable here but not on centralized exchanges. The [[Polymarket US retail API launches with 23 REST and 2 WebSocket endpoints for regulated trading|Polymarket API]] gives programmatic access, but the real edge comes from reading the chain directly.

The scoring system matters more than the copying mechanism. The author filters the top-50 traders down to those with a 90-day win rate above 68%, tracks entries via Polygon RPC, and only copies positions above $2,000. This mirrors the rigor described in [[becoming a prediction market quant requires five phases from Bayesian thinking through live deployment]] — you need statistical validation before deploying capital. A Sharpe ratio above 1.5 and rolling win-rate decay detection prevent you from following wallets that have lost their edge.

Position sizing uses [[Kelly criterion determines optimal prediction market bet size from three inputs|Kelly Criterion]] at a fixed fractional Kelly of 0.15 — deliberately conservative. The formula accounts for the whale's historical win rate and average payout odds. This conservative fraction makes sense for copy trading where you're adding slippage and latency on top of the whale's edge.

The wallet basket strategy is the most sophisticated insight: instead of following one whale, you build topic-based baskets of 5-10 proven wallets per category (geopolitics, crypto, sports). When 80%+ of wallets in a basket converge on the same outcome within a 24-48 hour window, that's a high-conviction signal. This is essentially ensemble learning applied to human traders.

Anti-signals are equally important: don't copy top leaderboard accounts (everyone already copies them, eroding the edge), don't copy market makers (they profit from spreads, not direction), and don't copy wallets with fewer than 100 trades (can't distinguish skill from luck). The cat-and-mouse game is real — top traders now split across secondary wallets, making behavioral pattern matching between accounts a necessary skill.

The latency budget is tight: 800ms detection to 1.2s order execution. Netherlands VPS placement for sub-1ms to Polygon is recommended. Every second of delay costs 0.5-2% worse entry. The system exits when the whale exits or 30 minutes before market resolution.

> - i monitor the wallets of top-50 Polymarket traders
> - filter only those with a 90-day winrate > 68%
> - track the entry moment via Polygon RPC
> - if a whale places > $2000 on a contract the system sees it in 800ms
> - i enter right after with fixed Kelly 0.15
> - i exit when the whale exits or 30 minutes before resolution
>
> the most important thing: don't copy everyone. 90% of Polymarket traders lose money. the system filters only those who are consistently right.

> i wrote the code in Python + WebSocket. delay from whale entry to my order: 1.2 seconds. not a single prediction required.

> **Why Copy Trading on Polymarket Is Even Possible**
>
> Polymarket runs on Polygon. Every single trade settles on-chain. Every buy is public, every sell is public, every wallet's full history is public. The CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) is hybrid-decentralized — orders are matched off-chain but settled on-chain through signed EIP-712 messages. There's no hiding. Polymarket CTF mints ERC-1155 tokens for every outcome (YES + NO). When you buy YES at $0.65, that trade is permanently recorded on Polygon. This transparency is the exploit.

> **The 3 Types of Whales**
>
> 1. Informed Traders (the edge) — few trades, high conviction, $50k-$500k per trade, focused on 1-2 categories, win rate >60% across 50+ trades. These are your targets.
> 2. Market Makers (ignore) — hold both YES and NO simultaneously, profit from spread not direction. Copying them gives zero edge.
> 3. Bot/Algo Traders (risky) — high frequency, exploit latency on 15-min crypto markets. You can't match their speed.

> Method A: Arkham Intelligence (no code). Method B: Polymarket Data API. Method C: WebSocket Real-Time Feed for live whale alerts.
>
> **Step 2: Scoring Wallets Before You Copy**
>
> Metrics: Sharpe Ratio (>1.5 required), Kelly Criterion for sizing, Win Rate Decay Detection (30-trade rolling window, stop if <55%), Expected Value per trade (>$50 after slippage).
>
> **Step 3: The Wallet Basket Strategy**
>
> After analyzing ~1.3M wallets: build topic-based baskets of 5-10 wallets per category. When >80% converge on the same outcome within 24-48 hours, enter.
>
> **Step 4: Anti-Signals**
>
> Don't copy top leaderboard accounts (edge already gone). Don't copy crypto-bot wallets. Don't copy wallets with <100 trades. Watch for secondary/tertiary wallets.
>
> **Step 5: The Pipeline**
>
> Polygon RPC → WebSocket listener → Whale scorer → Kelly sizing → CLOB execution. Netherlands VPS for sub-1ms to Polygon. Max 5% of portfolio per trade, max 2 open positions.
