# Recursive skill loops improve marketing outputs by generating, scoring, diagnosing, and iterating until thresholds are met

## Core claim
Marketing outputs get dramatically more consistent when you package them as a **recursive skill**: generate the asset, score it against explicit criteria, diagnose failures, rewrite, and repeat until every criterion passes.

## Key takeaways

- **Most prompting fails because it stops after the first draft.** The thread’s central move is to treat “first output” as raw material; the real leverage comes from structured iteration that pushes toward a target bar.

- **Quality criteria must be explicit and test-like.** Turn taste into a checklist with thresholds (for example: “thumb-stop power ≥ 9/10”), which is closer to an evaluation harness than a vague prompt. This mirrors how “evals” function as quality gates in agent systems (see [[OpenAI internal data agent succeeds through six layers of context not model capability alone]]).

- **The loop pattern is reusable across marketing artifacts.** The same generate→evaluate→improve loop is suggested for email sequences, video hooks, positioning, and SEO content—anything you do repeatedly.

- **Add adversarial pressure to prevent fragile copy.** Having the model adopt skeptical customer/competitor personas turns the evaluation step into an attack/defense test: if it doesn’t survive critique, iterate again.

- **This is a skill/system design pattern, not a one-off trick.** Save the loop as a reusable skill so every future run reuses the same standards — the kind of compound workflow that [[skill workflows]] describes as folder-based modules with progressive disclosure. This rhymes with file-backed iteration patterns like [[ralph loops prevents context pollution in long running ai builds]] and iterative creative workflows like [[agentic image generation loop]].

Gives examples across ads, email, video hooks, positioning, and SEO; recommends turning personal evaluation taste into explicit thresholds and adding adversarial critique personas.
