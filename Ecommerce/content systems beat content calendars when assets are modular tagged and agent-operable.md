description: A three-pillar content architecture (organic, paid, shared building blocks) that treats assets as composable, tagged objects agents can retrieve and recombine rather than one-off posts

## Key Takeaways

The central reframe is that you are not building posts — you are building a content system. Three pillars form a reinforcing loop: Organic Social creates reach and community signals (comments, saves, DMs, UGC), Paid Advertising converts that momentum into scalable acquisition, and Shared Building Blocks store what works as reusable atoms. This maps directly onto the campaign architecture in [[meta ads strategy]], where creative variety across formats (static, video, carousel, UGC) is the primary targeting lever under Meta's Andromeda algorithm. The shared building blocks layer is what makes that variety sustainable rather than exhausting.

Every effective asset follows a universal content equation: Hook + Mechanism + Proof + Outcome + CTA. This decomposition echoes the structure in [[advertising angles are testable hypotheses not copywriting]], where each angle encodes progress, tension, objection, and proof. The difference here is operational granularity — the equation applies at the asset level (what goes on screen second by second) while angles operate at the strategic level (why this audience will buy). Both systems require proof traceability: every claim must map to a Proof Card backed by demo footage, review snippets, official specs, or credible external sources.

The funnel model replaces TOF/MOF/BOF labels with intent language that better describes actual decision behavior: Discover ("What is this?"), Validate ("Is this legit?"), Decide ("Which option? What's the risk?"), Commit ("One last objection"). This aligns with Google's "messy middle" research showing people loop non-linearly between exploration and evaluation — which is why content must cover all intent states rather than assuming a linear progression. The practical test: reach content earns attention from strangers, trust content resolves doubts, conversion content makes the next step feel obvious.

The shared building blocks — visual assets, proof and trust library, copy library, editing and variant system — form the highest-leverage layer because they make content composable, consistent, searchable, and agent-operable. Visual assets split into four persuasion-mapped classes: A-roll (meaning), B-roll (process beauty), Proof-roll (belief), and Outcome-roll (payoff). The copy library is modular: hook banks, headline banks, caption banks, CTA banks (soft vs hard), and objection microcopy banks — all parameterized with bracketed variables for cross-product reuse.

The tagging system uses five enumerable categories (Format, Funnel, Angle, Proof, Module) that make every asset searchable and retrievable. A single clip tagged as Video / Validate+Decide / Mess-managed / Demo / Cleanup-beat can surface in dozens of recombination contexts. This is the infrastructure that enables the variant naming convention (`Concept-Angle-Hook-Variant-Format-Ratio`) described in the [[advertising angles are testable hypotheses not copywriting|angle framework's]] output layer, and what makes creative iteration measurable through component-level performance analysis.

The agent-oriented design defines content objects (Concept Cards, Proof Cards, Module Clips) with structured metadata that agents can retrieve and recombine rather than treating assets as opaque files. Six specialized agent roles divide labor: VoC Extractor, Angle Composer, Hook Writer, Storyboard Agent, Variant Generator, and Truth/Guardrails QA Agent. The QA agent enforces claim safety — every script claim must link to a Proof Card, and disallowed claims (like food-safety for air-dry clay) are caught automatically. This is the execution layer that [[advertising works when a content farm feeds modular assets into an agent-driven assembly line]] operationalizes into a seven-agent pipeline, providing the structured schema and agent prompts that bridge strategy documents to actual asset production for [[moc - BananaBank]].

Controlled variant testing follows strict rules: each variant changes exactly one element (hook swap, proof swap, CTA swap, edit pacing, caption, thumbnail) while holding everything else constant. Combined with cutdown templates (6s, 10s, 15s edit recipes), this creates a combinatorial multiplication of testable creative from a finite module library — the compound interest effect of the shared building blocks pillar.

## Original Content

> [!quote]- Source Material
> General-Purpose Content Strategy Reference System Built from Table Clay's Total Content Library
>
> **Executive synthesis**
> This document is a general-purpose content strategy reference system designed to apply across projects (new products, new angles, seasonal campaigns, new audiences), while staying grounded in the provided Table Clay inputs:
> - The Total Content Library diagram (three pillars + universal tags) as the system backbone
> - The Deep Research Dossier as the primary source for: jobs-to-be-done, objections, proof requirements, and voice-of-customer language/themes for the flagship example product
> - Official Table Clay materials (product page + brand positioning) as primary "source-of-truth" for offer/claims and real customer language
> - Select authoritative web sources used only to support general principles that are broadly true across projects (e.g., purchase journeys are not linear; word-of-mouth trust; ad delivery mechanics)
>
> **The core design idea**
> You are not building "posts." You are building a content system:
> - Organic Social creates reach, trust, and community momentum.
> - Paid Advertising converts that momentum into scalable acquisition, retargeting, and conversion.
> - Shared Building Blocks are the reusable atoms that make everything faster, more consistent, and more "agent-ready."
> This maps cleanly onto modern buyer behavior: between trigger and purchase, people loop through exploration and evaluation across touchpoints; it's rarely linear.
>
> **Why the right column matters**
> The diagram's right column (Visual Assets, Proof & Trust, Copy, Editing & Variants) is the highest-leverage layer because it makes content:
> - Composable (assets assemble into many formats)
> - Consistent (brand voice + proof standards persist across creators and campaigns)
> - Searchable (tags + naming conventions allow retrieval)
> - Agent-operable (agents can generate, transform, QA, and iterate modularly)
>
> **Key definitions used throughout**
> These definitions make the system portable across projects.
> Content pillar: A major function in the marketing ecosystem: Organic Social, Paid Advertising, Shared Building Blocks.
> Content family -> content type -> modules:
> - Family: a cluster by intent (e.g., "Organic UGC signals")
> - Type: a repeatable format class (e.g., "first try progress clips")
> - Modules: reusable building blocks inside the content (e.g., "wipe-down proof beat," "kit layout proof beat," "review overlay")
> Concept vs angle vs hook vs variant:
> - Angle = the persuasion lens (stress relief, gifting delight, mess-managed, skill progress).
> - Hook = the first 1-3 seconds that earns attention and frames interpretation
> - Concept = angle + proof strategy + content type (a complete persuasion unit)
> - Variant = same concept, but one controlled change (hook swap, proof swap, edit pacing change, caption change, thumbnail change)
>
> **What "good" content does in the funnel**
> Use this as a universal rule:
> Reach content earns attention from strangers. Trust content resolves doubts. Conversion content makes the next step feel obvious.
> Because "trust" is often the decisive layer: Nielsen reports that the most trusted channel globally is recommendations from people we know (word-of-mouth).
>
> **System architecture and content flow**
> This section turns the Total Content Library into a repeatable architecture that works across products while remaining grounded in Table Clay's real VoC and offer structure as the exemplar.
>
> The three-pillar loop:
> Organic Social is your "market sensing" layer: it reveals what people actually want, fear, and say.
> Paid Advertising is your "market penetration" layer: it applies proof + clarity at scale.
> Shared Building Blocks is your "compound interest" layer: it stores what works so you can reuse it everywhere.
>
> Funnel stages as audience intents:
> - Discover: "What is this?" "Do I care?"
> - Validate: "Is this legit?" "Will it work for me?"
> - Decide: "Which option?" "Is it worth it?" "What's the risk?"
> - Commit: "One last objection." "Buy now."
> This maps to the "messy middle" loop between exploration and evaluation that Google's research emphasizes.
>
> **A portable "content equation"**
> Across projects, almost every effective asset can be described as:
> Hook + Mechanism + Proof + Outcome + CTA
> - Hook: stop scroll
> - Mechanism: how it works / what it is
> - Proof: why to believe (demo, review, comparison, authority, risk reversal)
> - Outcome: the payoff (visual result, emotional relief, family moment)
> - CTA: what to do next (soft or hard)
> Table Clay example: the Mini Wheel page itself communicates mechanism ("compact, beginner-friendly wheel...no studio required") and offer clarity (bundles with specific clay weights and paint set contents).
>
> **Organic social content types**
> Organic is primarily for reach, trust, and community momentum (as labeled in the diagram). The key is not volume; it's coverage: enough content types to satisfy different audience intents and different "jobs."
>
> *Organic UGC signals*
> Definition: Content that looks and feels like user-created footage: imperfect, human, first-person.
> Primary purpose:
> - Convert skepticism into "people like me do this" (social proof)
> - Gather VoC language for future ads and site copy
> - Build legitimacy via community
> Funnel role: Discover -> Validate
> When to use:
> - When the product is unfamiliar and needs normalization
> - When objections are high and trust must be earned indirectly
> - When you need language that sounds like customers, not brands
> Core modules:
> - Imperfect first try (shows realism)
> - Mini reveal (before/after)
> - Quick review (what surprised me)
> - Duet/stitch replies (objection response)
> - Delight reaction (gift or first outcome)
> Swipeable hooks and opening lines (parameterized templates; swap bracketed variables per project):
> - "I thought [common objection]...until I tried [product]."
> - "POV: you needed a [job-to-be-done] hobby."
> - "First time trying [category]. Be honest -- how bad is it?"
> - "Day 1 vs Day 7 using [product]."
> - "This is what [promise] looks like in real life."
> Table Clay example language: "Small but impressive," "learning curve," "tools save you from having to make another purchase," "splash pan is easy to clean."
> UGC prompt examples:
> - "Film your first attempt. Leave in one mistake. Show the fix and the final result."
> - "Do a 20-second unboxing: show what's included, then show it working once."
> - "Answer one comment: 'Is it messy?' with a wipe-down proof beat."
> Common failure modes:
> - Too polished -> triggers "fake UGC" skepticism
> - Only talking -> no proof
> - No reveal -> viewer can't connect to payoff
> Avoidance rules:
> - Every UGC clip must include at least one proof beat (demo, cleanup, outcome, review overlay).
> - Never hide the learning curve + never overpromise outcomes.
>
> *Organic native storytelling*
> Definition: Platform-first content that feels like it belongs: POVs, comment replies, trends, mini-stories.
> Primary purpose: Make the brand feel like a person with taste, care, and credibility (Table Clay: "Made by Hand, Made with Care").
> Funnel role: Discover -> Validate
> When to use:
> - When the product needs context and meaning (why it exists)
> - When community questions can generate content loops
> - When you need to teach without looking like an ad
> Core modules:
> - Founder/maker POV
> - Comment reply video
> - Trend audio + educational overlay
> - "Aesthetic satisfaction" ASMR-friendly sequences
> - "Build in public" updates
> Swipeable hooks:
> - "I keep getting asked [objection] -- here's the real answer."
> - "3 things I wish I knew before trying [category]."
> - "If you've ever wanted [outcome], start with this."
> - "This looks simple, but here's why it works."
> Common failure modes:
> - Inspirational but vague (no mechanism, no proof)
> - Trend-chasing that breaks brand voice
> - Overlong setup -- no early payoff
> Avoidance rules:
> - Hook must deliver context + curiosity in 2 seconds.
> - Add one on-screen "what this is" label by second 3 for cold viewers.
>
> *Organic static and graphics*
> Definition: Carousels, infographics, quote cards, moodboards, and prompt graphics.
> Primary purpose: Saveable utility + identity reinforcement.
> Funnel role: Validate -> Decide
> When to use:
> - When people need steps, checklists, comparisons, "what's included" clarity
> - When the product has a learning curve and benefits from teachable structure
> Core modules:
> - Step-by-step carousel tutorial
> - Mini tips infographic
> - Quote card overlay (customer words)
> - "Challenge prompt" card
> Caption starters:
> - "Save this: [X-step guide]."
> - "Beginner mistake #1: [mistake]. Fix: [fix]."
> - "If you're worried about [objection], start here."
> Common failure modes:
> - Too text-heavy for mobile
> - Pretty but not actionable
> - No evidence (claims without proof)
> Avoidance rules:
> - Every static must do one job: "teach," "compare," or "prove."
> - Use proof overlays (review snippets, demo still frames, counts).
>
> *Organic long-form and live*
> Definition: Long tutorials, live Q&A, workshop-style recordings.
> Primary purpose: Deep trust + skill confidence + community rituals.
> Funnel role: Validate -> Decide -> Commit
> When to use:
> - When the product has meaningful technique/learning curve
> - When the audience wants reassurance "I won't fail"
> - When you want reliable, evergreen education assets
> Common failure modes:
> - Too advanced too fast (beginners drop)
> - No structure (viewers leave)
> - "Perfection demo" (intimidating)
> Avoidance rules:
> - Teach one "first win" project repeatedly.
> - Include a troubleshooting section every time.
>
> **Paid advertising content types**
> Paid is for acquire, retarget, convert (as labeled in the diagram). A general-purpose system must make paid creative:
> - modular
> - proof-heavy
> - variant-friendly
> - claim-safe
> Also, paid distribution mechanics reward ads that deliver valuable experiences: Meta describes auction outcomes as depending on bid, estimated action rate, and ad quality.
>
> *Paid UGC ads*
> Definition: Direct-response ads that look like creator content.
> Primary purpose: Fast trust + fast belief.
> Funnel role: Acquire -> Convert
> When to use:
> - When the category/product is novel
> - When skepticism is high
> - When social proof is your best persuasion mechanism
> Core modules:
> - Testimonial + demo
> - Problem -> solution
> - Unboxing + setup
> - Demo with quick wins
> - "Mistakes & fixes" credibility
> - Comparison angle
> - Giftable moment
> - Creator endorsement style
> Swipeable hooks:
> - "I didn't think this would work..."
> - "This solved my [job] problem in 15 minutes."
> - "Here's what surprised me."
> - "If you're worried about [objection], watch this."
> Proof requirements rule: Every Paid UGC ad must show at least 2 of:
> - demo proof (mechanism)
> - outcome proof (result)
> - objection proof (e.g., cleanup, torque, completeness)
> - social proof (review overlay)
> Table Clay example: bundle specifics and "30-day money back" can be used as proof/risk reversal.
> Common failure modes:
> - UGC talk with no demo
> - Over-scripted
> - Claims that cannot be proven on screen
>
> *Paid native ads*
> Definition: Ads that feel organic but are constructed to sell: hook-first demos, storytime reveal product, POV formats.
> Primary purpose: Stop-scroll entertainment + proof delivery.
> Funnel role: Acquire -> Convert
> When to use:
> - When the product is visually satisfying
> - When the mechanism is the hook
> - When you have strong "process beauty" footage (ASMR, transformation)
> Core modules:
> - Hook-first narrated demo
> - "3 reasons / 3 projects" structure
> - Bold captions + quick cuts
> - Social proof overlays
> - Offer clarity beat (what's included, bundle choice)
> Common failure modes:
> - Looks like an ad (banner energy)
> - Product unclear until too late
> - No decisive proof beat
> Avoidance rules:
> - Label the product by second 2-3.
> - Show the mechanism before you describe it.
>
> *Paid static and graphics ads*
> Definition: Single-image, carousel, or graphic-driven ads built for clarity and offer comprehension.
> Primary purpose: Make the offer legible. Reduce cognitive load in evaluation.
> Funnel role: Retarget -> Convert (also works for acquisition when paired with strong proof)
> Core modules:
> - Product hero
> - What's included kit layout
> - Benefit callout graphic
> - Carousel: steps/results/proof
> - Before/after skill progress
> Table Clay example: the product page already defines bundles by contents (wheel + tools + specific clay weight + paint set). This is exactly what static should mirror.
> Common failure modes:
> - Too much text
> - No proof (just claims)
> - Misleading lifestyle implying impossible outcomes
>
> *Paid retargeting and funnel assets*
> Definition: Assets designed to resolve the last objections and trigger purchase.
> Primary purpose: Objection killing + risk reduction.
> Funnel role: Retarget -> Commit
> Core modules:
> - FAQ rebuttal (difficulty, mess, shipping)
> - Social proof compilation (quotes/ratings)
> - "Still thinking?" reminder
> - Bundle/upsell highlight
> - Guarantee/risk reversal graphic
> Table Clay example: "30-day money back" + reviews addressing learning curve and cleanup can be combined into BOF assets.
> Common failure modes:
> - Retargeting that repeats TOF content (no new information)
> - Defensive tone (arguing with the viewer)
> - No proof matched to the objection
>
> *Paid research baseline for all projects*
> Two tools are general-purpose and reliable as inputs:
> - The Meta Ad Library is an official way to see active ads and is useful for competitor concept sampling.
> - CPM is a standard metric defined by Meta as spend / impressions x 1,000.
>
> **Shared building blocks libraries**
> This is the "right column" system the user explicitly flagged as critical, expanded into a systematic, agent-friendly library.
>
> *Visual asset library*
> Stop thinking in "A-roll and B-roll." Use four visual classes that map to persuasion:
> A-roll: the "meaning" layer
> - Talking head, POV narration, testimonial voiceover
> - The line that frames interpretation
> B-roll: the "process beauty" layer
> - Hands, textures, steps, environment
> Proof-roll: the "belief" layer
> - Demo that answers the objection (torque test, cleanup wipe, kit completeness layout)
> - Receipts: review overlays, screenshots, ratings (permissioned)
> Outcome-roll: the "payoff" layer
> - Finished product reveal, before/after, lifestyle context, "shelf moment"
>
> *Universal b-roll shot list master*
> Use this as a copy/paste template across products; replace bracketed items per category.
> Product + mechanism:
> - [Product] in hand (scale reference)
> - [Mechanism] in 1-2 seconds (turn on / transformation / application)
> - Close-up of key moving part or interaction
> Setup:
> - Unbox -> lay out components
> - "Everything included" flat lay
> - First-touch moment (most tactile first moment)
> Process:
> - Step 1 macro
> - Step 2 macro
> - Step 3 macro
> - One intentional "mistake" moment (for realism)
> Proof:
> - Objection test: [mess / difficulty / durability / speed / power]
> - Side-by-side comparison: [old way] vs [new way]
> - "Receipt overlay": review snippet or rating badge (permissioned)
> Outcome:
> - Before/after reveal
> - In-use context (home, desk, gift, family moment)
> - Final beauty shot (lighting, texture)
> Cleanup / aftercare:
> - Wipe-down
> - Rinse tools
> - Storage shot
> Table Clay-specific examples that must be represented in the proof library because they map to core objections/themes in the dossier: mess management, learning curve realism, mini scale expectations, and "no studio required" convenience.
>
> *Proof and trust library*
> A general system needs proof types that map to the messy middle: people evaluate and explore using cues like social proof, authority cues, and reassurance.
> Proof types taxonomy (use across projects; tag every proof asset):
> - Demo proof: "watch it work"
> - Outcome proof: before/after, finished result
> - Social proof: reviews, UGC compilation
> - Authority proof: expert endorsement, standards, certifications
> - Comparison proof: alternatives vs your offer (classes vs kit, DIY vs done-for-you)
> - Risk reversal: guarantee, return policy, free trial
> - Mechanism clarity: what's included, how it works, what to expect
> Table Clay proof examples available from official sources: review text and bundle-line clarity on what's included, plus return policy messaging on-page.
> Claim safety rule: Any claim used in copy must be supported by at least one of:
> - a proof-roll clip
> - a credible review snippet
> - an official spec/policy statement
> - a trustworthy external source (only when needed)
> Example: Air-dry clay food/water expectations. Crayola explicitly warns finished pieces should not contact food or liquids, and that sealing won't make it waterproof. This is the kind of general truth that must flow into your "guardrails" library.
>
> *Copy library*
> This is not "write captions." This is a modular system:
> - Hook bank (0-2 seconds)
> - Headline bank (static)
> - Caption bank (short/medium/long)
> - CTA bank (soft/hard)
> - Objection microcopy bank
> Hook bank templates:
> - "If you're worried about [objection], watch this."
> - "I tried [product/category] so you don't have to."
> - "This is the fastest way to get [job-to-be-done]."
> - "POV: you needed a [identity] hobby."
> - "Day 1 vs Day 7 with [product]."
> Headline bank templates:
> - "Everything you need to [outcome]."
> - "[Job] at home -- no [common barrier]."
> - "Beginner-friendly, actually."
> - "Less [objection], more [benefit]."
> - "A gift that turns into a memory."
> Table Clay exemplar language for headlines: "no studio required," "beginner-friendly," and bundle clarity (clay weights, paint set counts).
> CTA bank:
> Soft CTAs (reach/trust):
> - "Save this for later."
> - "Comment 'GUIDE' and I'll send the steps."
> - "Which one would you make first?"
> Hard CTAs (conversion):
> - "Choose your bundle and start your first project."
> - "Tap to see what's included."
> - "Get it in time for [occasion]."
> Objection-handling microcopy templates:
> - Mess: "Designed to be table-friendly -- wipe down and rinse." (must be proven on screen)
> - Learning curve: "Your first try doesn't need to be perfect to be satisfying."
> - Value: "Compare to [alternative] cost/time/effort."
> - Durability/limits: "Here's what it's for -- and what it's not for."
>
> *Editing and variant system*
> A general-purpose system needs controlled, repeatable variant dimensions.
> Aspect ratios (from the diagram): 9:16, 1:1, 4:5.
> Rule-of-thumb:
> - 9:16 = first-person and demo feels native
> - 1:1 = proof montage / compilation
> - 4:5 = static clarity and offer legibility
> Cutdown templates (define as edit recipes agents can apply):
> 6s cutdown: Hook visual -> proof beat -> outcome flash -> CTA
> 10s cutdown: Hook line -> mechanism clip -> objection proof -> outcome -> CTA
> 15s cutdown: Hook -> mini story/problem -> demo -> proof -> reveal -> CTA
> Thumbnail styles:
> - Macro "mechanism moment" + 3-word promise
> - Finished result in hand + "I made this"
> - Kit layout + "Everything included"
> Subtitle templates:
> - Utility style: numbered steps, minimal fluff
> - VoC style: overlay real customer language (most powerful trust cue)
> - Proof style: "Watch this test" framing
> Naming convention (keep universal):
> Concept-Angle-Hook-Variant-Format-Ratio
> Example: UGCReview-MessManaged-WipeTest-V3-Video-9x16
>
> **Universal tagging system**
> The diagram already proposes universal tags. This section refines them into an agent-usable metadata schema with definitions and examples.
> Tag categories and definitions (keep tags short, enumerable, and searchable):
> Format tags: Video, Static, Carousel, Live, Story
> Funnel tags: Discover, Validate, Decide, Commit (prefer over TOF/MOF/BOF because it maps to intent)
> Angle tags: Stress relief, Giftable, Beginner-friendly, Skill progress, Mess-managed, Affordable alternative, Social activity, Home decor
> Proof tags: Demo, Review, Rating, Before/After, Comparison, Risk reversal, Authority, Kit layout
> Module tags: Hook, Mechanism, Proof beat, Outcome, CTA, Cleanup, Unboxing, Tutorial step
> Tag usage examples:
> - Funnel = Audience intent state (e.g., Validate)
> - Angle = Persuasion lens (e.g., Mess-managed)
> - Proof = Why believe (e.g., Demo + Review)
> - Module = Asset fragment (e.g., Cleanup beat)
> Example: one asset tagged systemically -- a "wipe-down proof clip" for Table Clay:
> - Format: Video
> - Funnel: Validate / Decide
> - Angle: Mess-managed
> - Proof: Demo
> - Module: Cleanup beat
> - Notes: "answers top objection"
>
> **Agent-oriented content system design**
> This section defines the system so agents can operate with high reliability and low hallucination risk.
>
> *Agent-ready content objects*
> Don't store "videos." Store content objects with metadata and modular components agents can retrieve and recombine.
> Concept Card:
> - Angle
> - Persona / intent
> - Hook options (10-30)
> - Required proof beats (must include)
> - Required visuals (must show)
> - Disallowed claims (guardrails)
> - Output formats (Organic UGC, Paid UGC, etc.)
> Proof Card:
> - Claim it supports
> - Proof type
> - Source (official spec, review snippet, demo clip)
> - Usage notes (where it works best)
> Module Clip:
> - Clip type: mechanism / proof / outcome / cleanup
> - Duration options
> - Crops available (9:16, 1:1, 4:5)
> - Transcript and on-screen text extracted
>
> *Agent roles and their inputs/outputs*
> These roles are not a calendar; they are a division of labor that can be reused across projects.
> VoC Extractor Agent:
> - Input: dossier + reviews + comment exports
> - Output: ranked themes, exact phrasing, objections, desired outcomes
> Angle Composer Agent:
> - Input: VoC themes + offer
> - Output: 15-30 angles, each with proof requirements and "failure mode" warnings
> Hook Writer Agent:
> - Input: angle + persona + platform style
> - Output: 30 hooks + 10 opening lines + caption starters
> Storyboard Agent:
> - Input: chosen hook + required proof beats
> - Output: shot list + module order + edit recipe
> Variant Generator Agent:
> - Input: concept card + approved module library
> - Output: controlled variants (hook swaps, proof swaps, CTA swaps) with naming + tags
> Truth and Guardrails QA Agent:
> - Input: script/caption + claims
> - Output: pass/fail with required proof mapping and disallowed claim detection (e.g., no food-safe claims when using air-dry clay)
>
> *Example agent prompt templates*
> Hook Writer Agent prompt skeleton:
> "Generate 25 hooks for:
> - Angle: {angle}
> - Persona: {persona}
> - Primary objection: {objection}
> - Proof to include: {proof_types}
> Constraints: 6-12 words, no hype words, must feel like UGC."
> QA Agent prompt skeleton:
> "List every claim in this script. For each claim, point to a Proof Card ID that supports it. Fail any claim without a proof link."
>
> **Measurement language, best practices, and failure modes**
> This section defines success by intent, not by vanity.
>
> Success definitions by pillar intent:
> Reach content (Organic Social primarily): Success = attention from cold audiences + saves/shares that indicate relevance.
> Trust content (Organic + Paid): Success = objections surfacing in comments in a way you can answer; DMs; profile taps; "is it legit?" questions decrease over time.
> Conversion content (Paid primarily): Success = offer comprehension improves (fewer "what is included?" comments), and "last-mile objections" decrease.
>
> Paid measurement mechanics:
> CPM is defined by Meta as spend / impressions x 1,000.
> Meta also explains delivery is influenced by bid, estimated action rate, and ad quality.
> Interpretation rule: creative that improves viewer experience can improve distribution efficiency because ad quality is part of auction outcomes.
>
> **Common failure modes summary**
> These "don'ts" are universal across projects:
> - Claims without proof -> Fix: every asset must map claims to proof cards.
> - Overpromising outcomes -> Fix: state the honest scope. Table Clay example: "mini" expectations and learning curve show up even in reviews.
> - Ignoring top objections -> Fix: make objections visible and answer them with proof beats. The dossier calls out mess, learning curve, quality concerns, and durability expectations as crucial.
> - Confusing offer -> Fix: kit layout module + clear bundle ladder. Table Clay's product page models this with explicit bundle contents.
>
> **Guardrails for truth and expectation management**
> - Do not imply air-dry clay is food-safe or waterproof; Crayola explicitly warns against food/liquid contact and notes sealing won't waterproof.
> - Don't portray "mess-free" if the real state is "mess-managed."
> - Don't make "perfect result" the only story; keep learning curve visible to reduce intimidation.
>
